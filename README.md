# Saturn-Racing-PC

I wanted to use my Sega Saturn racing controller on the PC, so I did this little project.  
The Arduino pro micro does the controller to PC interface.  

I've reversed the protocol and made my own functions to read the controller status.  
I then used a Joystick library from MHeironimus, see below or in code for the link, which made the Arduino pro micro into a USB HID Gamepad/Joystick.  

# Hardware

Connections are explained in the code, but I'll make a schematic just in case.  
You'll need an Arduino pro micro for this.  

# Software

I've tried adding some comments in the code. But all in all I think it's fairly simple.  
Feel free to ask me on twitter or discord if you have any issues.  

# Controller Protocol
